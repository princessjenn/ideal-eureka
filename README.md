# Module 1 Challenge

## Description
This week's challenge was to start out with a starter-code, and refract the existing code so that I can improve it without changing what it does.
I consolidated the css selectors and renamed div elements into semantic elements for easier accesibility of the user.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
 The user will be able to access functioning links on the webpage, and easily identify and view containers in viewport. The application's css properties are organized and consolidated so that developers don't have to read repetitive properties applied to the same elements in HTML.
